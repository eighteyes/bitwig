#bitwig control scripts

### bitwig for touchosc
=====
It just works, yay! Drop in the generic folder.

### bitwig for maschine
======
Needs to be dropped in a 'Native Instruments' folder.

This is just the beginning for a BitWig driver for the Maschine. I moved the default drums to C1 Base, mapped some basic recording functions to page 1 and 2 of the knob button stack. There is also arrows mapped to page H. There's loads more that can be done here, star this bugger and give it a whirl. 

Feedback and ideas are welcome.

There is also a fork of an incomplete version of the Maschine Script written by BitWig developers. These things are handy to keep around as a reference. 

Look at the fluff directory for API dumps, observer tests, a node MIDI script to find device names, and other detrius of this process.
