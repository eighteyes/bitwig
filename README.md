### bitwig for maschine
======

This is just the beginning for a BitWig driver for the Maschine. I moved the default drums to C1 Base, mapped some basic recording functions to page 1 and 2 of the knob button stack. There is also arrows mapped to page H. There's loads more that can be done here, star this bugger and give it a whirl. 

Feedback and ideas are welcome.
